- Run plot extraction method (/Plot-Extraction/run.sh) on story summaries (/stories/) to get extracted plot lines

- Use the extracted plot lines for Hierarchical, BERT, and C2PO methods (further instructions in respective folders)
The stories folder has the 10 randomly picked ones for used for plot extraction in the evaluation
